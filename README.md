# Robo AI - Live Lecture Repository
This repository contains all the resources corresponsing to the lectures taught by me (in live classes) at MyEquation. This includes (but is not limited to) hand-written codes, notebooks, slide-decks, examples, and much more to be updated eventually.

‚≠ê this repository to stay up-to-date with the lectures.

### Happy learning to you!
